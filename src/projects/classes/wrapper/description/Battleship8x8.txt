Battleship 8x8

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with wrapper classes and their static methods.
Estimated workload of this exercise is 3 hours.

Description
Please, implement methods in Battleship8x8 class.

Battleship8x8 represents a 8x8 map for Battleship game.
An important detail is that Battleship8x8 uses a ships field of long type to store ships locations and a shots field of long type to register shots.

Fields of long type value store 64 bits each.
Consider them as 8 rows per 8 cells. '0' bits represent empty cells,
'1' bits represent cells seized by ships or registered shots.

public boolean shoot(String shot) - Registers a shot and returns true if the shot hits a ship.
A shot is a combination of one of A-H letters and one of 1-8 digits
public String state() - Returns a string representing state of the map.
Map string is 8 lines per 8 characters separated by "\n". Use following symbols:
- '.' - an empty cell
- '×' - an empty cell that has been shot
- '☐' - a cell seized by a ship
- '☒'- a cell seized by a ship that has been shot
You must not add or change new fields. Consider using static methods of wrapper classes.
