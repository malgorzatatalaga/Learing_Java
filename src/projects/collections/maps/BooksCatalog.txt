Books Catalog
The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use Map collections.

Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes

Description
In this task, you will simulate work with a book catalog. The catalog can be represented as the TreeMap collection,
where the author is the key and the list of published books is the value. You have the following description:

- The Author class, which consists of the first and last name
- The Book class, which consists of the title, genre, and cost
Since the book catalog is an ordered map, the Author and Book classes must implement the Comparable interface.
The BooksCatalog class must have two constructors: a default one and one with a parameter that creates a map based
on an existing map.

Please proceed to the Author and Book classes and provide implementations of the compareTo() method.

Please, proceed to the BooksCatalog class and provide implementations of the following methods:

- List<Book> findByAuthor(Author author)
Returns a list of books by the specified author or null if there is no such author in the catalog
- List<Author> findAuthorsByBook(Book book)
Returns a list of the authors of the specified book or null if there is no such book in the catalog
- String getAllAuthors()
Returns a list of all the authors as a String
- Set<Book> findBooksByGenre(String pattern)
Returns a set of books of the specified genre or null if there are no books of this genre
- Map<Book, List<Author>> findAuthorsByBookTitle(String pattern)
Returns the book/author pair map. The search is carried out based on the words in the book's title

Restrictions
You may not use lambdas or streams when implementing this task.
