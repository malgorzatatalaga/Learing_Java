Student’s Grade Book
The purpose of this exercise is to work with Comparator implementations on the TreeMap maps.

Description
In this task, you will simulate the work of the student's grade book. The internal structure of the grade book is a collection of the TreeMap type where a key is an object of the Student type, the value is a HashMap whose key is the name of a discipline (an object of the String type), and the value is the grade (an object of the BigDecimal type).
The Student class describes a student with the following characteristics: first/last name and group. All characteristics are passed to the constructor to create an object. You must not change this class.
Now, please proceed to the StudentsGradeBookImpl class, which implements the StudentsGradeBook interface, and provide implementations of the following methods:

- public GradeBookImpl()
Creates the grade book object in which a Comparator is described to compare students
boolean addEntryOfStudent(Student student, String discipline, BigDecimal grade)
Adds a student entry to the grade book; returns true if the addition was successful, and false if not.
- int size()
Returns the number of students in the grade book
- Comparator<Student> getComparator()
Returns the Comparator, which is used to compare students
- List<String> getStudentsByDiscipline(String discipline)
Gets a list of strings with students' names and their grades for the specified disciplines in the format "first_last name : grade"
- Map<Student, Map<String, BigDecimal>> removeStudentsByGrade(BigDecimal grade)
Finds, removes, and returns from the grade book students who have a grade below the specified one in any discipline
If no such students are found, an empty map will be returned
- Map<BigDecimal, List<Student>> getAndSortAllStudents()
Gets the grade book as an ordered map where the key is the average grade and the value is a list of the Student type
Details
- Since the Student objects are the keys to the grade book, when you create the gradeBook, you will need to declare the Comparator to compare objects of the Student type and pass it to the TreeMap<Student, Map<String, BigDecimal>> constructor.
- The grading scale for any discipline is in the range [0 .. 5]. The minimum passing grade is 3 points.
- The removeStudentsByGrade method returns a map ordered by the Student type. To create the resulting map, you must use the Comparator applied in the gradeBook constructor.
- The getAndSortAllStudents method generates a gradeBook based on the student's average grade. The average grade is indicated in increments of one tenth—for example, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, etc.
- It is guaranteed that the parameters passed to all methods are correct.
- You can add any private methods to the StudentsGradeBookImpl class.
