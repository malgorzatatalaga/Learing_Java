    This record guarantees immutability of the values in the record fields and eliminates the need to create a constructor,
    methods equals(Object), hashCode(), and toString(), which are generated automatically for the record.
    Instead of getters, methods with a field name are generatedâ€”in this case, name() and itemId().
